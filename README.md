# Radar-using-arduino
1. Firstly to processed with this source code .<br>
2. You need to download the compatible software to run it .<br>
3. This is the link of the software on which we can run our source code( https://processing.org/ ) .<br>
4. Then after downloading the software , install it as per the accepting the terms and conditions . <br>
5. After that you can run the source code in that software and enjoy determining the objects which are present in the range of radar .<br>
6. <b> Purpose </b>: The purpose of this project is to determine any object within a range of radar . It uses Microwaves to determine the range, altitude, direction, or speed of objects. The radar can transmit radio waves or microwaves which bounce off any object in their path. So, we can easily determine any object in the radar range. Adruino is a single-board microcontroller to make electronics more discipline. This system is also used in autonomous vehicles (ie : tesla ) . It is very useful in the security purposes .<br>
7.Output somehow looks like this :-<br>
